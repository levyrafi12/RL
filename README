OS and Python version:
----------------------
the code was developed and tested in windows7 and in python 3.6.4
Testing in nova: 
  In a strange way I was able to run mnist in python 2.7.6 only.
  Running the agent problem failed. Seems that the failure happened when it
  tried to display the CartPole video. I could not find a way to disable it
  or somehow setting the DISPLAY to my laptop screen.
