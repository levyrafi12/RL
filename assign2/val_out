    Winter is here. You and your friends were tossing around a frisbee at the park
    when you made a wild throw that left the frisbee out in the middle of the lake.
    The water is mostly frozen, but there are a few holes where the ice has melted.
    If you step into one of those holes, you'll fall into the freezing water.
    At this time, there's an international frisbee shortage, so it's absolutely imperative that
    you navigate across the lake and retrieve the disc.
    However, the ice is slippery, so you won't always move in the direction you intend.
    The surface is described using a grid like the following

        SFFF
        FHFH
        FFFH
        HFFG

    S : starting point, safe
    F : frozen surface, safe
    H : hole, fall to your doom
    G : goal, where the frisbee is located

    The episode ends when you reach the goal or fall in a hole.
    You receive a reward of 1 if you reach the goal, and zero otherwise.

mdp.P is a two-level dict where the first key is the state and the second key is the action.
The 2D grid cells are associated with indices [0, 1, 2, ..., 15] from left to right and top to down, as in
[[ 0  1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6  7]
 [ 8  9 10 11]
 [12 13 14 15]]
Action indices [0, 1, 2, 3] correspond to West, South, East and North.
mdp.P[state][action] is a list of tuples (probability, nextstate, reward).

For example, state 0 is the initial state, and the transition information for s=0, a=0 is 
P[0][0] = [(0.3333333333333333, 0, 0.0), (0.3333333333333333, 0, 0.0), (0.3333333333333333, 4, 0.0)] 

As another example, state 5 corresponds to a hole in the ice, in which all actions lead to the same state with probability 1 and reward 0.
P[5][0] = [(1.0, 5, 0)]
P[5][1] = [(1.0, 5, 0)]
P[5][2] = [(1.0, 5, 0)]
P[5][3] = [(1.0, 5, 0)]
